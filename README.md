## Algorithm:
Identifying and Writing Problem Statements
Identify user pain points. Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). Justify your method choice. 3. Creating Personas

Based on previous user data or a given user scenario.

Create at least two user personas with: Demographics Goals Behaviors Pain points

## Output:
### 1.Identifying and Writing Problem Statements ○ Identify user pain points. ○ Write 1–2 clear UX problem statements using a defined template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]." 2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods ○ Identify the most suitable research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing, diary studies). ○ Justify your method choice. 3. Creating Personas Based on previous user data or a given user scenario. ○ Create at least two user personas with: ■ Demographics ■ Goals ■ Behaviors ■ Pain points ■ Motivations Scenario 1: Designing a Health & Fitness Mobile App
### 2.Identifying and Writing Problem Statements User Pain Points: ● Difficulty maintaining consistent tracking of physical activity and nutrition due to complicated app interfaces. ● Lack of personalized workout plans that match individual fitness levels and goals. ● Motivation decreases over time because progress is not clearly visible or rewarding. ● Difficulty integrating the app into busy daily routines. Problem Statements: ● PS1: Users need a way to track their daily physical activities and diet easily because existing health apps have complex interfaces and require too much manual input, which results in inconsistent tracking and decreased motivation. ● PS2: Users need personalized workout recommendations because current fitness apps offer generic plans that don’t adapt to their unique fitness levels and goals, which results in ineffective workouts and user frustration.
### 3.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Research Methods: ● User Interviews: To gather qualitative insights into users’ fitness habits, challenges, and motivations. This helps understand the emotional and contextual factors influencing app usage. ● Diary Studies: Users log their daily activities, app interactions, and challenges over 1-2 weeks. This method captures real-world behavior and pain points in natural environments, revealing usability issues and feature gaps. ● Competitive Analysis: Analyzing existing fitness apps to understand what works and what doesn’t from a UX perspective. Justification: Interviews allow deep exploration of user needs and frustrations. Diary studies provide longitudinal data on actual user behaviors and challenges during app usage, which are difficult to capture in a one-time session. This combination ensures both depth and context, guiding feature prioritization and UI simplification.
### 4.Creating Personas Persona: Active Anna Persona: Busy Ben Demographics: 28 years old, female, Marketing Executive in urban area Demographics: 40 years old, male, Software Engineer with demanding work hours Goals: Maintain a healthy lifestyle, track progress in endurance and strength, participate in community fitness challenges Lose weight, build muscle efficiently, fit workouts into a busy schedule Behaviors: Uses multiple fitness apps, checks progress daily, prefers detailed stats and graphs, attends gym 4x a week Exercises sporadically, prefers short, guided workouts, often forgets to log meals or workouts Pain Points: Finds apps overwhelming due to cluttered UI, struggles to log meals accurately, gets demotivated if progress plateaus Limited time for workouts, dislikes complex apps, gets frustrated with one-size-fits-all workout plans Motivations: Enjoys social sharing and challenges, motivated by visible progress and rewards Wants quick, effective workouts that maximize limited time, appreciates reminders and easy logging Scenario 2: Designing an E-commerce Website for Sustainable Products
### 5.Identifying and Writing Problem Statements User Pain Points: ● Difficulty verifying product sustainability due to vague or inconsistent labeling. ● Lack of trust in the company’s green claims, creating hesitation in purchase decisions. ● New visitors are confused about the brand’s values and sustainability mission. ● Complex navigation making it hard to find eco-friendly products quickly. Problem Statements: ● PS1: Eco-conscious shoppers need a way to easily identify and purchase verified sustainable products because current websites have unclear product information and certifications, which results in hesitation and lost sales. ● PS2: First-time visitors need a clear introduction to the company’s sustainability practices because the website lacks accessible educational content and onboarding, which results in low trust and engagement.
### 6.Identifying Appropriate Research Methods Research Methods: ● Usability Testing: Conduct task-based sessions where users find and purchase products, allowing observation of navigation difficulties, confusion around labels, and trust signals. ● Surveys: Collect quantitative data on users’ attitudes toward sustainability, their trust level in online eco-brands, and preferences for product information presentation. ● Card Sorting: To optimize site navigation and product categorization focused on sustainability attributes. Justification: Usability testing reveals practical navigation and comprehension challenges in real time. Surveys provide a broader understanding of customer values and perceptions. Card sorting helps design an intuitive product categorization system that reflects users’ mental models, improving findability of sustainable products.
### 7.Creating Personas Persona: Eco Emily Persona: Skeptical Sam Demographics: 35 years old, female, High School Teacher, lives in a metropolitan city Demographics: 45 years old, male, Accountant, suburban resident Goals: Purchase truly eco-friendly and ethically sourced products, support sustainability causes, reduce carbon footprint Support sustainability when possible but avoid “greenwashing,” seeks transparent information before buying Behaviors: Reads detailed product descriptions and labels, follows environmental blogs, shares product recommendations on social media Shops online frequently but compares brands rigorously, reads reviews, values evidence over marketing Pain Points: Frustrated by misleading claims and unclear certifications, overwhelmed by excessive jargon Finds sustainability claims vague, distrusts marketing buzzwords, struggles to find trustworthy brands Motivations: Wants to make ethical choices that align with personal values, motivated by community and social proof Motivated by factual transparency, clear proof of sustainability, and cost-effectiveness

## Result:
To Present 2 different UX project scenarios (e.g., designing a health app, an e-commerce site, or a government service portal) is completed
